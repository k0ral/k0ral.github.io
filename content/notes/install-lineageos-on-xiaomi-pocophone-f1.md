Go to [Lineage OS wiki for beryllium](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/beryllium/install), **read everything once** first, then follow instructions with the following changes:

- In section "Unlocking the bootloader"
  - after enabling developer options, go to `Settings > Additional Settings > Developer Options` and enable `USB Debugging` and `OEM Unlocking`
- In section "Installing LineageOS from recovery"
  - before doing anything, download latest firmware (for Android 10) from [Xiaomi Firmware Updater](https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/firmware/beryllium/)
  - before sideloading the LineageOS package, sideload the Xiaomi firmware update
