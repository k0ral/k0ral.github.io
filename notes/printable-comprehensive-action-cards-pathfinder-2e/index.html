Nothing fancy, it&rsquo;s mostly formatted-text, but still.</p><h2 id=coverage>Coverage</h2><p>The set includes the following elements from the <em>Core Rulebook</em>:</p><ul><li>basic actions (that any character can perform most of the time)</li><li>specialty basic actions (useful under specific circumstances), except for <em>Activate an Item</em></li><li>skill-related actions</li><li>exploration and downtime activities</li></ul><p>Actions from <em>Gamemastery Guide</em> and <em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</em> are not included (for now.)</p><h2 id=rationale>Rationale</h2><p>My motivation is to selectively distribute such cards to willing players, according to the capabilities of their characters, so that:</p><ul><li>players are aware of the range of standard actions offered by the ruleset</li><li>the effort to check most of the action rules is lowered from &ldquo;browse the rulebook/Archives of Nethys&rdquo; to &ldquo;find and read the relevant card you already have in hand&rdquo;</li><li>players are empowered to contribute to the collective effort of obeying the spirit of the rules</li></ul><h2 id=how-this-was-made>How this was made</h2><p>I made the following design decisions:</p><ul><li>to allow for more content per card, I picked the Tarot format (70mm x 121mm = 2.75″ x 4.75″), which is bigger than the more traditional Poker format (63mm x 88mm = 2.5″ x 3.5″) while remaining convenient to Manipulate</li><li>I had to reword, sometimes even truncate, some rules, to fit in the card format; when significant details were cut, I added a &ldquo;See rulebook&rdquo; mention</li><li>as another trick to compress the information, I &ldquo;invented&rdquo; the <em>Trained</em> trait for actions that require the character to be Trained in a specific skill</li><li>actions that have short descriptions and are closely-related to each other, are grouped in a single card</li><li><em>Activate an Item</em> is excluded because I couldn&rsquo;t find a concise way of describing it, other than just &ldquo;check the item description&rdquo;, which defeats the purpose of making a card</li><li>after trying many tools (namely <em>Inkscape</em>, <em>Karbon</em>, <em>Scribus</em>, <em>Python</em> & <em>Cairo</em>, <em>TeX</em>, <em>AbiWord</em>), to my own surprise I settled with <em>LibreOffice Writer</em> to design the cards, because experiments showed that it has the best &ldquo;good-looking / time-consuming&rdquo; ratio, notably because I am Untrained in graphics and also I realized a word-processor makes sense when most of the work involved is text-formatting</li><li>my workflow to go from the ODT file to actual cards is:<ul><li>export to PDF from <em>LibreOffice Writer</em> (built-in feature)</li><li>convert PDF to 1 image file per page using <em>ImageMagick</em> (you must be <em>Trained</em> in commandline): <code>convert -density 300 -trim cards.pdf -quality 100 card-%03d.jpg</code></li><li>upload image files to an online card printer</li></ul></li></ul></main></body></html>
