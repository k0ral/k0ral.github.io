As a consequence, early-adopters can enjoy the new API while other users aren’t impacted in their daily workflow. In other words: the new API is opt-in.</p><p>To be accurate, here is an example procedure:</p><ul><li>let <code>A.B.C.D</code> be the latest published version (assuming you are following the <a href=https://pvp.haskell.org/>Haskell PVP</a>)</li><li>release a new version <code>A.B.C.(D+1)</code> that only includes additional deprecation markers to warn users about the upcoming breaking change;</li><li>release a new version <code>A.(B+1).0.0</code> that includes the breaking changes</li><li>on Hackage, set the “Preferred versions” such that <code>A.B.C.(D+1)</code> is preferred over <code>A.(B+1).0.0</code></li><li>after a reasonable time, remove the preferred version so that <code>A.(B+1).0.0</code> becomes the new default</li></ul><p>As is often the case, one size does not fit all: this strategy may not be appropriate to your project, but it is worth considering.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/software-craftsmanship class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">software-craftsmanship</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://k0ral.github.io/>&copy; My digital garden 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
